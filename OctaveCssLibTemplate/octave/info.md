# Octave Info

# Use classes like "underline" or "fs-200" to change the style of your element.
# Do mind that not every number like 167 or 483 will work. You can add more advanced numbers in "./octave/o-custom.css"
# For custom fonts, you can import them into "./octave/o-custom.css", "./octave/presets/fonts" or use the "CDNs" section in "index.html"
# o-setup.css is used for setting global values. Changing anything in it might break it.
